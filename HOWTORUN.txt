To run the within subject, simply run withinSubject.py in your IDE. The 
program should automatically download the subject from the PhysioNet dataset, 
and run through the training

For cross subject, a model has been pre-trained for the sake of time.
To run on this pre-trained model, simply run "runCrossSubModel.py", and the 
program will download the necessary data from the PhysioNet database, then train.

To train a new cross subject model, run "crossSubject.py". Note that this may take a long time,
as it needs to both download the dataset (which is around 3GB) and then train.
